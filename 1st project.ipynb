    "\n",
    "**✅ What's Working Exceptionally Well**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Handling and Preparation: You proficiently loaded the dataset, performed initial inspections, and effectively cleaned the data by renaming columns and correcting specific entry errors (e.g., \"In??s Prieto\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effective Data Filtering and Extraction: Your ability to filter the DataFrame for specific criteria (e.g., high IMDb scores, specific actor names) and extract unique sets of data (e.g., movie titles) was implemented perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robust Function Creation: You successfully developed several well-defined functions (`get_unique_top_movies`, `get_actors_for_title`, `categorize_imdb_score`) that correctly performed their intended tasks and handled edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no critical issues, so your project is accepted — great job! Congratulations once again on your journey and your first hands-on experience. This is just the beginning of many exciting milestones ahead, and I’m confident you’ll continue to grow and excel with each step you take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I’d be grateful for your feedback on this code review. It’s a great help for me in making sure I’m explaining things clearly and supporting you well.\n",
